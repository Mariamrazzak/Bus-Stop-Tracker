# Bus-Stop-Tracker
This is a bus tracker for the bus route between Rundberg lane to 11th street in Austin, Texas.

**Description of the project:**

The goal of this project was to map out a real time bus tracker between two different locations. The bus route I picked runs from Rundberg lane to 11th street in Austin, Texas. Some changes I made to my map compared to the map we built in class, are:

This map uses a different font style (Italic)
The location of the map is based out of Austin and not Massachusetts.

**How to Run:**

Open the index.html file, click on the "Route between Rundberg and 11th street" and the tracker will move on the bus route for this bus line.

**Roadmap for future improvements**:
I would like to showcase the map in different terrain and with different colors with multiple bus routes.
